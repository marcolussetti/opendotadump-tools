Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, more commonly known as a MOBA. The core gameplay revolves around teams of five players choosing from a character pool of over one hundred characters and facing off against another five person team in a race to destroy a large structure located in the enemy’s base called The Ancient. The publisher of Dota 2, Valve, hosts an annual tournament with a prize poll in the millions of dollars. To keep the game bug free, competitive and fresh, Valve implements frequent patches affecting character balance as well as introducing new playable characters. Thanks to the OpenDota (formally Yasp) project, a very large dataset has been created that has gathered over two billion matches of Dota 2 from 2011 to 2016. We will use this data to predict changes in the metagame due to patches as well as observe the impact of The International.
